# NTech-Explorer
An educational platform designed for Indigenous students and adults in the Northern Territory to foster sci-tech learning.

## Introduction
In this project, an educational app called 'NTech Explorer' was programmed- It's a simple, user-friendly platform which is designed especially for indegenous students and adults to use for sci-tech learning. It allows students to access modern and easy-to-understand teaching videos as well as science subjects' materials. There's also quiz games for students to practice and play with. Additionally, Aboriginal adults can get updated about news, research, articles, etc on recent science and technology advances in the Northern Territory. Furthermore, with a pre-trained NLP model from Facebook AI, users can condense text into a short paragraph to quickly grasp the essence of a research paper or article. Finally, a chatbot was integrated to guide users through the app and help translate academic or difficult words into any aboriginal language.

## Methodology
I applied knowledge obtained from the unit HIT137 - Software Now to design and program this app.

They are: Class, Tkinter, functions, reading data from text file, loops, if-else statement, text processing, etc.

I've also added a feature to the app where Facebook AI's NLP Model condenses lengthy academic articles, and an OpenAI Chatbot assists in translating complex academic English terms into indigenous languages and answering basic queries.

## Installation and usage guide
tkinter: This is the standard GUI (Graphical User Interface) library for Python. It's bundled with most Python installations, so you typically don't need to install it separately.

webbrowser: This is a module in Python's standard library that provides a high-level interface to allow displaying Web-based documents to users. Since it's part of the standard library, you don't need to install it separately.

PIL (Pillow): This stands for Python Imaging Library. However, the library's development has been taken over by a fork called "Pillow".
You need to install Pillow if you want to use Image and ImageTk. Installtion: pip install Pillow

openai: This is the Python client for the OpenAI API. If you want to use OpenAI's services, you need to install the OpenAI Python package. Installation: pip install openai

transformers: This is a library provided by Hugging Face and contains various state-of-the-art machine learning models, including the BART model. To use BartForConditionalGeneration and BartTokenizer, you'll need to install the transformers library. Installtion: pip install transformers

After installing all required packages, you should be able to run the program. However, on the login window, only IDs and passwords stored in 'contacts.txt' are given permission to get access. You should use one of the accounts in the text file to log in.
